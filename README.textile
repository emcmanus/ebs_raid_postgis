h1. Amazon EC2 PostGIS 1.4 on RAID-x n-disk EBS Array Build Script

We all know EC2, but it does have it's drawbacks and they are mainly related to disk IO. When using EC2/EBS with large spatial datasets you can easily run into IO bottlenecks. Individually, these are not such a big deal, but when you are conducting global analyses, or need a more reliable response time, poor disk IO on EC2/EBS can quickly become a problem.

To help alleviate this, there is a trend of people stringing together EBS volumes and creating their own software RAID-0 arrays to achieve higher read and right throughput.

I pieced together bits and bobs to create a script that creates a PostGIS database on an n-volume RAID array on EC2. It's pretty simple stuff, but should mean that instead of hours, you can get your 20 volume RAID-0 PostGIS test rig up and running in minutes.

This script creates a multiEBS software RAID-0 array, installes PostgreSQL, PostGIS and sets the data directory to the RAID array.

The aim of this script is to quickly create a test environment for understanding how Amazon EC2 and EBS can be optimised to enable high IO GIS operations on large spatial datasets.
